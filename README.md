# Welcome to the Test Repo

This is a repository designed to test new employees with hidden challenges. It is built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the dependencies by running `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Run the development server using `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`.
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to see the result.

## Challenges

This repository contains hidden challenges that new employees are expected to solve. These challenges are designed to test their skills and knowledge in various areas of software development.

Task List for New Employees:
